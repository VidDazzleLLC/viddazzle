## Objection Handling

### "We already have a CRM"

✅ **That's our specialty!** Our AI analyzes each prospect's recent activity, pain points, and context to generate truly personalized messages—better than most humans.

### "What if it sounds robotic?"
✅ **Show them a sample.** Our AI uses consultative tone, references specific challenges, and includes relevant context. 95% of prospects can't tell it's automated.

### "How do I know it won't spam people?"
✅ **Built-in safeguards:**
- AI lead scoring (only contact 7+ scores)
- Rate limiting (respects platform limits)
- Unsubscribe tracking
- Deliverability monitoring

### "What's the setup time?"
✅ **15 minutes.** Just connect your:
1. CRM (API key)
2. Email platform (Blastable account)
3. Social accounts (OAuth)
4. Tell us your ICP (ideal customer profile)

### "Can I customize the workflows?"
✅ **Absolutely!** You can:
- Edit any workflow step
- Add custom tools/integrations
- Build entirely new automations
- Use natural language: "Add a step that..."
